# Covid-Analysis
 
## Overview

The Covid Analysis repo was created as a pet project to analyze the current Covid-19 crisis. The data for the repo is taken directly from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University  ( CSSEGISandData / COVID-19 repo https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This project will likely change often based on newer expectations on the questions that need answers.

The data from the Github repo is availabe in daily csv files (also available in time-series data) that can be downloaded freely from the repo. 

## Process

### Step 1 - Retrieve the source files

A batch (???) file was created to enable the refreshing of the repo that will include the new daily files.

It was set up to run automatically using XXX (mac) and similarly Windows Task Manager.

### Step 2 - Import the data into SQL Server

An SSIS package was created to process the lastest file for importing into a Staging Table.

Once the file has been imported, a stored proc is run to process the data into a format that can be readily used in Business Analytics software such as Tableau or Power BI.

NOTE: The format of the csv files and subsequent data changed from January until current date. There was some manual cleanup of the data that was necessary.

### Step 3 - Connect the data to Business Analytics software.

The resulting data consists of just one table that contains all of the necessary information. An Azure SQL database was established to connect to the data.
